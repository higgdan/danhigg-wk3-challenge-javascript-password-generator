# danhigg-wk3-challenge-javascript-password-generator

For the third weekly challenge, my task was to write JavaScript code that generates a stong, random password following a series of user prompts. The prompts defined the password length and which character sets were to be used (ie. lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters). The prompts were also to be validated.

The HTML and CSS for this appliication, as shown below, were provided and were not altered.
